    <h2>Low technology greenhouse</h2>
    <p>
      Is the lowest priced greenhouse. A low-cost greenhouse is a basic building
      made of locally accessible materials like bamboo and timber. The cladding
      materials are made of ultraviolet (UV) film. There is no specialized
      control device for managing environmental conditions within the
      greenhouse, unlike conventional or high-tech greenhouses. However simple
      techniques are used to increase or decrease temperature and humidity. Even
      the intensity of light can be lowered by using shading materials such as
      nets. During the summer, the temperature can be lowered by opening the
      side walls.

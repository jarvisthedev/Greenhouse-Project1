    <h2>Greenhouse Cost by Type</h2>
    <p>
      There are several greenhouse types and styles that come with their own
      pros and cons. Your areaâ€™s climate will help determine which type is best
      for you. Costs vary tremendously.
      Greenhouses can be classified typewise from rooftop for those who would like to have greenhouse but the ground isn't suitable for it. To deme greenhouses for those who like greenhouse but with alittle beauty in it. Here are cost examples of common greenhouse types:

        Costing between <b>$5</b> and <b>$10</b> per square foot, hoop greenhouses are made
        from multiple half- hoops in a row. Most of the hoop is above the ground
        and its ends are buried in the soil. Typically, the hoops are covered
        with a sheet of plastic.

        Rooftop greenhouses are often located in urban areas on the tops of

        Geodesic or dome greenhouses are round structures with domed tops. They
        can be made from a variety of materials, including glass and plastic,
        and cost between <b>$10</b> and <b>$25</b> per square foot. While these types of
        greenhouses have a relatively small footprint, they can house many
        plants because of their tall shape. That makes them ideal for small
        spaces.

        One of the most common greenhouse types is the A-frame. It has a high
        roof that slopes down to the ground to create an A shape. This
        greenhouse type works well in areas with lots of snowfall as the sloped
        roof allows snow to slide off without piling up and damaging it. A-frame
        greenhouse costs range from <b>$25</b> to <b>$35</b> per square foot.

    <h2>Greenhouse Cost</h2>
    <p>
      Greenhouses can range from the size of a shed to an industrial-sized
      building. Most hardware stores sell greenhouse-building kits that allow
      you to build a standard one yourself. But if you prefer something larger
      and more customized, consider hiring a professional. Building one can cost
      between <b>$2,500</b> to <b>$25,000</b>, or about <b>$15,000</b> on
      average.

      <h2>Price Classification</h2>
    </table>
    <h3>Greenhouse Cost Per Square Foot</h3>
    <p>
      The cost to build a greenhouse will increase as its square footage
      increases. That said, prices per square foot actually decrease as the
      overall square footage increases. It still makes for a higher total, but
      the cost increase won’t be exponential.
    </p>

    <p>
      Standard mid-sized greenhouses cost <b>$25</b> per square foot on average.
      Large commercial greenhouses that consist of plastic or fiberglass over a
      steel framework, and may or may not include ventilation and plumbing, cost
      between <b>$2</b> and <b>$4</b> per square foot.
    </p>

    <h3>Cost of Materials</h3>
    <p>
      Greenhouses are simple structures that consist of a frame, siding and a
      floor. Materials for these components vary but can include wood, steel,
      glass, concrete and plastic.
    </p>

    <p>
      The frame of a greenhouse is the structure’s support system. Typically,
      greenhouse frames are made from strong wood or steel that can stand up to
      the elements. Wood framing costs about <b>$1</b> per linear foot, while
      steel costs <b>$2.50</b> per linear foot.
    </p>

    <p>
      Siding is another important feature of a greenhouse that protects plants
      from the elements and lets in lots of sunlight to nourish them. Glass
      siding is common in greenhouses and costs <b>$2.50</b> per square foot.
      Glass is heavy, though, so you will likely need a strong steel frame to
      support it. Polyethylene and fiberglass are low-cost alternatives.
    </p>

    <p>
      While greenhouses can function without a proper floor, flooring does have
      its benefits. It helps to insulate the structure while preventing weed
      growth and stops pests from entering and destroying plants. Rolled rubber
      flooring is a common choice for greenhouse flooring and costs
      <b>$2</b> per square foot. Concrete, stone, brick or even mulch are other
      greenhouse flooring options. Whatever material you choose must provide
      some sort of drainage.

    <h2>Medium technology Greenhouse</h2>
    <p>
      Is regarded as a moderate cost and technology level used greenhouse. Due
      to the minimal investment, greenhouse users prefer a manually or
      semi-automated control system. Galvanized iron (G.I) pipes are used to
      create this type of greenhouse. With the help of screws, the canopy cover
      is attached to the framework. To withstand wind disturbance, the entire
      construction is firmly attached to the ground. The temperature is
      controlled by exhaust fans with controls. Evaporative cooling pads and
      misting systems are also used to keep the greenhouse at a comfortable
      humidity level.he minimal investment, greenhouse users prefer a manually

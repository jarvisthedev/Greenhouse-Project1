        A greenhouse is a structure with walls and roof made chiefly of
        transparent material, such as glass, in which plants requiring regulated
        climatic conditions are grown.These structures range in size from small
        sheds to industrial-sized buildings. A miniature greenhouse is known as
        a cold frame. The interior of a greenhouse exposed to sunlight becomes
        significantly warmer than the external temperature, protecting its
        contents in cold weather.

        The modern greenhouse is usually a glass- or plastic-enclosed framed
        structure that is used for the production of fruits, vegetables,
        flowers, and any other plants that require special conditions of
        temperature. The basic structural forms are the span-type greenhouse,
        which has a double-sloped, or A-shaped, roof, and the lean-to
        greenhouse, which has only one roof slope and leans against the side of
        a building. Two or more span-type greenhouses are sometimes joined side
        by side so that they have fewer external walls, and heating costs are
        consequently less. A greenhouse has a large expanse of glazing on its
        sides and roof so that the plants are exposed to natural light for much
        of the day. Glass has been the traditional glazing material, but plastic
        films, such as polyethylene or polyvinyl, and fibreglass are also
        common. The framing of the structure is made of aluminum, galvanized
        steel, or such woods as redwood, cedar, or cypress. A greenhouse is
        heated partly by the rays of the Sun and partly by artificial means,
        such as circulating steam, hot water, or hot air. Because a greenhouse
        can become too hot as well as too cold, some type of ventilating system
        is also needed; this usually consists of roof openings, which can be
        operated mechanically or automatically, and end-wall openings, through
        which electric fans draw air and circulate it throughout the interior.

        Greenhouses are inflatable structures with transparent covering that are
        used to produce crops in a controlled environment. Greenhouse
        cultivation and other forms of controlled environment cultivation have
        emerged to generate ideal microclimates in which crop production can
        take place all year or portion of the year as needed
